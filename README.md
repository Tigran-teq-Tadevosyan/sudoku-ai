# Sudoku AI

## Description

Our aim was to find a unique solution puzzle generation algorithm that has polynomial time complexity. The main concept of this algorithm is that we can choose some entries that can uniquely determine the value of all the blank entries in a specific subset, therefore making the puzzle uniquely solvable. Out of all the appoaches attempted local beam search and inference backtracking were most efficnet (all the alogorithms are desscribed in depth in [here](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/3rd-ed/)).
